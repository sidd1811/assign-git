1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
A gitignore file is never intended for source control. It is a file that is never staged even when edited to avoid a situation where a project member's project does not build as they generally store a member's local library as well as folder paths.
For a java project gitignore file is .classpath file.

2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?
A fast-forward push scenario in Git is when a member's changes does not conflict with master branch when they try to push their changes into the master branch.

3. Why should you have different branches?
We create branches for versioning of a project. They are provide a safe alternative to back ups as well as a member can revert to an old version of project at any time. They also help member's to avoid conflicting merges in order to achieve a fast-forwarding push scenario.

4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
There are generally two remote Git repositories in a project. One for the UI and another for the backend.
